1. what is the relatio between convolutions and correlations?
    a. convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third function.
    b. correlation on the otherhand measures the similarity between two signals or datasets.
    c. convolutions take in discrete signals such as digital images, it involves sliding a filter (also known as a kernel or mask) over the signal and computing the element-wise product betweeen the filter and the signal at each location and then summing the products; the resulting output represents a filtered version of the original signal.
    d. in correlation it involves comparing a reference signal with another signal by sliding the reference signal over the other signal and computing the element-wise product at each location and then summing the products; the resulting output represents a measure of simialarity between the two signals.
    e. the relationship between convolutional and correlation lies in their mathematical similarity.
    f. Mathematically, convolution can be thought of as correlation with a flipped (reversed) filter
    g. This relationship is often used in practice, especially in image processing and pattern recognition.
    h. By using correlation, it is possible to detect patterns or templates in an image by comparing them to a reference template. Convolution, on the other hand, is widely used for applying filters to images, such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and feature extraction.
