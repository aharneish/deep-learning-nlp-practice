1. what is the relatio between convolutions and correlations?
    a. convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third function.
    b. correlation on the otherhand measures the similarity between two signals or datasets.
    c. convolutions take in discrete signals such as digital images, it involves sliding a filter (also known as a kernel or mask) over the signal and computing the element-wise product betweeen the filter and the signal at each location and then summing the products; the resulting output represents a filtered version of the original signal.
    d. in correlation it involves comparing a reference signal with another signal by sliding the reference signal over the other signal and computing the element-wise product at each location and then summing the products; the resulting output represents a measure of simialarity between the two signals.
    e. the relationship between convolutional and correlation lies in their mathematical similarity.
